==============

Easily retrofit awesome keyboard navigation to you app with almost no code


This project was partially inspired by 

http://www.impressivewebs.com/demo-files/question-mark-js/

But I didn't simple want a nice help modal, I want the actual keyboard short cuts.

Programaticly wiring up keyboard events is just boring and cumbersome, it should be effortless with the absolute minimum of delcarative markup, and things like the help modal should be generated for free.
